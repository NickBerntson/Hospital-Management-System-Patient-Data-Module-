# Hospital Management System â€“ Patient Data Module

This project is part of a group-based **Hospital Management System** built using SQL. The system is divided into modules to handle different aspects of hospital operations, such as patient data, doctor records, and appointment scheduling.

## My Contribution

I was responsible for the **Patient Data Module**, which includes:

- Creating the "patients" table
- Defining appropriate data types and constraints
- Adding column-level comments for clarity
- Inserting realistic sample data for testing

## Technologies Used

- SQL (Oracle syntax)
- Visual Studio Code (for formatting and editing)

**Note:** This code is written with Oracle SQL syntax in mind (e.g., `VARCHAR2`, `TO_DATE`, `NUMBER`). Minor changes may be needed for other SQL dialects.
